 <h3 id="headline">Jack Black At A Glance:</h3>
<p>Some of you might know him as R.L Stein from the <a href=" http://sites.sonypictures.com/goosebumps/discanddigital/" target="_blank"> Goosebumps </a> movies, others might know him as <a href="https://kungfupanda.fandom.com/wiki/Po" target="_blank"> Po </a> from Kung Fu Panda. Some of you might even know him as his lucha character <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457510/" target="_blank">Nacho Libre</a>. Jack Black is a man of many characters - you could even say of multiple lives. I word it like this only to alert to the interesting fact that Jack back got his first big break in a commercial for the Atari video game classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall!" target="_blank">Pitfall!</a>. Just to let you know, in case you donâ€™t want to click through, the link is a Jungle crawling adventure-not unlike his most current film franchise <a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/movies/jumanjithenextlevel" target="_blank"> Jumanji</a>. Whatever you might know him for, here are some weird and wonderful facts about Jack Black.</p>
